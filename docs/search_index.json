The S&amp;P 500 is a major index of the market values of the 500 biggest companies listed in the US. An option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to buy or sell something in the future. Options on the S&amp;P 500 are cash settled, the difference between the (strike) price of the option and the value at expiry is paid to the holder of the option who will exercise it if it is profitable to do so (called in the money). In seminal work Black and Scholes showed it is possible to create an option-like payoff by trading the underlying security in a dynamic fashion. The only unknown in this model is the volatility between the time the option is purchased and it expires - by examining market prices and making some assumptions about trading and the process stock prices move this can be solved for and is usually called the implied volatility. The VIX was created to summarize these options prices and is an average across a range of strike prices for options expiring in the next 30 days. Some people believe it reflects investors view of future expected stock market volatility, and is often called the markets fear gauge. It is considered the worlds premier barometer of equity market volatility and some investors use the VIX to measure the level of risk or stress in the market when making investment decisions. Using this index, we will pursue the answer to the following questions: Q1) Can we use VIX to predict future drops of stock prices, and are there any specific types of recession periods that VIX could foresee more easily? Q2) Are there more appropriate industries to use VIX for predicting the future drops? Q3) Are there any other appropriate characteristics of companies, such as company size, each company geography (ex. Americas, Europe, and Africa), and each company theme (ex. ESG, Value, Growth, and developed, emerging, and frontier markets), to use VIX for predicting future drops?

Stock indices data we took from the Fama-French website https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html this is a well known dataset that has been used by many academics for asset pricing tests, not least the original Journal of Finance paper https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1992.tb04398.x This provides a rich dataset of daily data for which we can calculate our returns on, the data library includes returns on factors (which can be thought of as important risk characteristics (or covariances) of stock price movements) and various other portfolios such as sectors. Data collection In this section we get the data and process it a little - giving the dates consistent format and converting variable types. ## Rows: 50,213 ## Columns: 12 ## $ X [3m[38;5;246m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m 19260701, 19260702, 19260706, 19260707, 19260708, 19260709, 19260710, 19260712, 19260713, 1926~ ## $ NoDur [3m[38;5;246m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m 0.02, 0.29, 0.24, 0.27, 0.69, -0.39, 0.67, 0.27, -0.46, -0.36, 0.00, 0.11, 0.60, -0.01, -0.45,~ ## $ Durbl [3m[38;5;246m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m -0.28, 1.07, 0.72, 0.06, 0.05, -1.15, 1.23, 0.78, 1.92, 0.65, -0.74, 2.41, 1.22, 0.64, -0.36, ~ ## $ Manuf [3m[38;5;246m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m -0.23, 0.81, 0.22, 0.23, 0.15, -1.10, 0.78, 0.25, 0.74, 0.37, -0.32, 0.92, 0.33, 0.18, -0.79, ~ ## $ Enrgy [3m[38;5;246m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m 0.57, 0.64, 0.17, -0.04, 0.12, -1.60, 0.65, -1.27, 0.37, -0.54, -0.11, 0.50, 0.08, -0.40, -0.5~ ## $ HiTec [3m[38;5;246m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m -0.21, 0.36, 0.47, -0.10, 0.35, -0.73, 0.39, 0.03, 1.64, 0.95, -1.19, 0.76, 0.93, 0.33, -1.26,~ ## $ Telcm [3m[38;5;246m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m -0.02, 0.26, 0.17, 0.32, 0.40, 0.21, 0.07, 0.15, 0.03, -0.01, -0.20, 0.06, -0.16, -0.01, 0.01,~ ## $ Shops [3m[38;5;246m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m -0.01, 0.01, -0.23, -0.58, -0.36, 0.40, 0.52, 0.27, 0.32, 0.25, -0.76, 0.06, 0.75, 0.33, -1.47~ ## $ Hlth [3m[38;5;246m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m 0.97, 0.13, 0.23, 0.33, 0.91, -0.28, -0.17, 0.22, 0.57, 0.09, -0.45, 0.23, 0.38, -0.78, -0.57,~ ## $ Utils [3m[38;5;246m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m 0.61, 0.47, 0.73, 0.17, -0.20, -0.74, 0.55, 0.23, 0.20, 0.52, -0.38, 0.32, 0.24, 0.29, 0.08, -~ ## $ Other [3m[38;5;246m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m 0.20, 0.10, -0.18, 0.16, 0.39, -0.25, 0.55, 0.37, 0.28, -0.23, -0.59, 0.06, 0.03, -0.28, -0.39~ ## $ DATE [3m[38;5;246m&lt;date&gt;[39m[23m 1926-07-01, 1926-07-02, 1926-07-06, 1926-07-07, 1926-07-08, 1926-07-09, 1926-07-10, 1926-07-1~ Now we have the data in an appropriate format for R purposes, we can proceed with some initial diagnostics We see the data for the VIX is far from normally distributed with a rather extreme right skew, suggesting these periods might be time of high option prices (and therefore financial stress) ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: tail(df1$Mkt.RF, -5000) ## W = 0.881, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 The data on the overall market also a distribution quite different from normal - in this case the qqplot clearly shows much fatter tails than expected.
