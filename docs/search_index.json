[["index.html", "VIX Analysis Chapter 1 Introduction", " VIX Analysis Alex Saunders &amp; Masataka Koga 2021-12-14 Chapter 1 Introduction Stockholders own stock corporations and also determine their management policies. Stock price represents the markets current evaluation of future gains produced by the company. If the trading price of stocks increases, then shareholder wealth also directly rises. Therefore, companies are required to manage their business so that the stock value rises and have to pay close attention to it. On the other hand, macroeconomic activities also greatly affect the price, like its recent sharp drop around the world due to the pandemic of Covid-19. Since the stock price is a corporation value including expected future profits, it fluctuates fairly rapidly in response to shifts of the external environment and premise of valuations alters, even if the business details of the individual company has not changed. Thus, for stock investors, forecasts of sudden price movements are quite valuable. However, the macroeconomy is more difficult to predict than individual economic activities because it is the total sum of the individual ones, and the impact of macroeconomy on stock company values is also difficult to evaluate. Additionally, the stock price is linked not directly to the actual effects on companies but to the ones expected by stock market participants. Hence, its sudden changes are very tough to foresee. One way to more accurately predict this extremely unpredictable and sudden change is to utilize the market volatility estimates of stock market participants, which more directly affect stock prices. The VIX is created to reflect investors view of future expected stock market volatility, markets fear gauge, and is considered the worlds premier barometer of equity market volatility. As far as we know, this index is not analyzed enough publicly, especially in the current market situation and in a dynamic way from the past to the current days. We often hear that investors use it to measure the level of risk, fear, or stress in the market when making investment decisions. Using this index, we will pursue the answer to the following questions: Q1) Can we use VIX to predict future drops of stock prices, and are there any specific types of recession periods that VIX could foresee more easily? Q2) Are there more appropriate industries to use VIX for predicting the future drops? Q3) Are there any more appropriate regions to use VIX? We collected daily VIX data from Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (https://www.cboe.com/tradable_products/vix/vix_historical_data/) and stock indices data offered on the website Kenneth R. French, the Roth Family Distinguished Professor of Finance at the Tuck School of Business, Dartmouth College, (https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html). In the following sections, we will analyze these questions and introduce insights on predicting the stock price fluctuations employing the VIX. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 VIX data 2.2 Stock indices data we took from the Fama-French website", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 VIX data Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe) provides the daily VIX data (VIX_History.csv) in its website, https://www.cboe.com/tradable_products/vix/vix_historical_data/. It is created to reflect investors view of future expected stock market volatility, markets fear gauge. Cboe Options Exchange makes the VIX index by S&amp;P 500 index options. Options, ones of the financial derivatives, are the financial products which give buyers the right to buy or sell the underlying financial asset. Since the price of the options are adjusted by traders forecasts about the underlying asset, which is S&amp;P 500 in the case of S&amp;P 500 index options, it includes the information about volatility of their forecasts. Though there are lots of data referred as fear index, such as the VXN index for NASDAQ, the VSTOXX index, the VDAX index, and the VSMI Volatility index for Europe, and the Asian VXJ index for Japan, we chose VIX because it is one of the most famous volatility indices. VIX_History.csv has the following data of 8038 records from Jan. 2, 1990 to Nov. 30, 2021 at Dec. 1, 2021. We will analyze the VIX value in the Close column because the other data is made based on the values when the market is close. Table 2.1: VIX data columns Column Name Description Date The date of the VIX value (date) Open The VIX value when the market is open (num) High The highest VIX value on the date (num) Low The lowest VIX value on the date (num) Close The VIX value when the market is close (num) Issues with this dataset: -The data format is clean and must be exactly calculated based on the accurate S&amp;P 500 data because Cboe is the largest U.S. options exchange market. So, we do not have any problem about the data from this perspective. -The VIX only has the information based on S&amp;P 500. The limited traders in the world would check it. However, this is one of the points we want to analyze on this final project. The distribution of the VIX Close value: In the graph below, the blue curve is a density curve of the data and the red curve is the density curve of normal distribution with the same mean and the same standard deviation. We can see the data is far from normally distributed with a rather extreme right skew, suggesting traders regarded that the market is not in financial crisis in the most periods. 2.2 Stock indices data we took from the Fama-French website https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html this is a well known dataset that has been used by many academics for asset pricing tests, not least the original Journal of Finance paper https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1992.tb04398.x This provides a rich dataset of daily data for which we can calculate our returns on, the data library includes returns on factors (which can be thought of as important risk characteristics (or covariances) of stock price movements) and various other portfolios such as sectors.

We checked this using the function built in a previos porblem set. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 VIX Prediction for Future Crisis in Different Time Periods 5.2 Analysis of Relations Between Industries and VIX 5.3 Analysis of Relations Between Regions and VIX?", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 VIX Prediction for Future Crisis in Different Time Periods To analyze the VIX and average stock return data in US markets, we first compared them in the graph below. The blue line shows VIX value, the red curve is the non-parametric loess smoother for VIX value, the swinging line around zero represents US average portfolio return (%), and the periods colored by green indicate high VIX periods. Hereafter, xx_R like US_R means the return data. This graph clearly shows that high VIX leads to high volatility of the US average stock return. Especially, a very high VIX causes intense fluctuations of the return. The graph below shows comparison between VIX and actual cumulative changes of US average portfolio value. Hereafter, xx_V like US_V means the value data. We can see a high VIX leads to not only high volatility but also huge fall of stock values. Especially, from August 2008 to June 2009 and from February 2020 to February 2021, there are comparably high VIX values and sharp plunges of stock values. Since they are the periods of the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 Crisis, times we know were of great worry and uncertainty in markets, the VIX must be capturing traders fears. The next graph with boxplots and a regression curve tells us implications about concrete threshold of VIX values indicating the high level of concerns in the market. US_R_n on y axis is non-positive values of US average stock returns, which means the US average stock returns whose positive values were changed to zero. We focused on these non-positive values because our goal is to confirm the possibility of using the VIX to avoid investment risks, not to improve total trading return. The graph indicates clear negative correlation with narrow confidence interval between the return and VIX. Also, the boxplots imply that above 70 or more VIX values have strong potential of market crisis. This implication makes sense because only the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 Crisis caused such a high values from 2001 to date. The following graph shows boxplots and regression of non-positive returns of US average portfolio on VIX values in four time periods with 5 year durations, 2001 to 2006, 2007 to 2011, 2012 to 2016, and 2017 to 2021. The all four periods have both relatively high VIX values and low values, and their graphs show negative relations. On the other hand, we can confirm that there are clear difference of average VIX values among the four periods. 2001 to 2006 and 2012 to 2016 do not have values higher than implicated threshold (70). However, in the two periods, 40 or more VIX leads to return falls, while around 60 or more seems to be threshold in 2007 to 2011 and 2017 to 2021. We can guess that the threshold may change in different financial circumstances because people are getting used to the bad situation when it longs. In high VIX periods, traders may not be surprised by high volatility of stock values. Additionally, we think that they probably cannot avoid to trade because investment is their work even when the risk is a bit high. 5.2 Analysis of Relations Between Industries and VIX To analyze stock returns in different industries, we analyzed the return data on industries value-weight market portfolio in the US. They represent the average market returns in each of 5 industries, Cnsmr, Manuf, HiTec, Hlth, and Other. Cnsmr means the industry comprised of Consumer Durables, Nondurables, Wholesale, Retail, and Some Services, such as Laundries and Repair Shops. Manuf includes Manufacturing, Energy, and Utilities, HiTec indicates Business Equipment, Telephone and Television Transmission, and Hlth contains Healthcare, Medical Equipment, and Drugs. Other consists of Mines, Constr, BldMt, Trans, Hotels, Bus Serv, Entertainment, and Finance. The below graph created by the ggpairs function in GGally package shows scatter plots, density distribution, and correlations between the VIX and the returns in each industry. Here, XXX_R_n means that the return is converted to non-positive values as US_R_n. We can see the high correlation between each industry and VIX. While the graph shows HiTec and Other have stonger relation with VIX than Cnsmr, Manuf, and Hlth, other information can be read by only this. The below graph shows changes of VIX and cumulative changes of average portfolio value in each industry in the US. Here, since the purpose of the graph is not to confirm actual VIX value but to compare it with the returns, we multiplied 5 to VIX value and deducted 400 from it to show the value and all returns in one graph. From this graph, we could not obtain useful characteristics to conclude that there are the differences of relations VIX and the returns in each industry. Then, we confirmed boxplots and regression curves in the following graph. While it exhibits strong negative relationships like the above analysis about all US average stock portfolio, especially on 70 or more VIX values, the boxplots did not provide distict differences among industries. Although we attempted to describe the original return data with some positive returns as follows, there are not hints of how to employ VIX differently according to industries. Finally, we thought that the time period between 2016 to 2021 may had different characteristics because it was highly likely that the COVID-19 Crisis affected each company differently, such as companies in Hlth and HiTec. Nevertheless, we should not deduce something special in the graph below. As a result, we concluded that there is not differences of the predictive capability by VIX depending on industries. 5.3 Analysis of Relations Between Regions and VIX? To conclude our question, Are there any more appropriate regions to use VIX?, we analyzed the return data on regions value-weight market portfolio in North America, Europe, Asia, and Japan. They represent the average market return in each region. The below pair-wised graph shows scatter plots, density distribution, and correlations between the VIX and the returns in regions. XX_R_n is the same definition written in the previous section. Here, stock price about companies in North America has the strongest relation with VIX, -0.42, while that for Japan has the weakest correlation, -0.242. In the scatter plot about VIX and NA_R_n, we can see the most clear in the VIX range of 40 or more. On the other hand, that for Japan has around -8% returns even in the VIX range of 40 or less. The graph below shows that Japanese average stock price is more durable than others, especially after 2010. Even though there were several spread of Covid-19 also in Japan, the stock price fall in 2020 is also smaller than others. It implies the economy is in a bit strange situation. This seems to make sense because Bank Of Japan has bought a lot of financial products consistently to improve its financial markets and economy since 2010. The boxplots and regression show that there may the threshold of VIX in 70 or more in North America, Europe, and Asia. Especially, markets in North America move more heavily when the VIX exceeds teh threshold than Europe and Asia. On the other hand, this graph makes it stand out how abnormal Japanese stock market is. It seems to have the threshold on around 80. The abnormality stands out more in the following graph for 2016 to 2021. It shows the market impact of Covid-19 is more powerful in North America and Asia than Europe. On the contrary, the Japanese stock market looks like VIX does not affect the market at all. However, as the pairwise analysis above indicates, there is smaller correlation at high level of significance between Japanese stock returns and VIX values.

However, the forecast of macroeconomy changes and the effect on the price are is more difficult to predict than individual economic activities. We analyzed VIX, considered as markets fear gauge, as a one way to more accurately predict this extremely unpredictable and sudden change. In conclusion, we got answers below. Q1) Can we use VIX to predict future drops of stock prices, and are there any specific types of recession periods that VIX could foresee more easily? We can employ it to precdict drops even though the power of prediction is limited in some points. In the more severe financial crisis, the VIX will work. Q2) Are there more appropriate industries to use VIX for predicting the future drops? As far as the analysis on five industry genres in the US market, we could not find the differences of VIX prediction effect on stock returns. Q3) Are there any more appropriate regions to use VIX? The US market is the most appropriate, then Europe and Asia. Japan is the least probably because of the abnormal investment by Bank Of Japan on financial products in Japanese markets.
